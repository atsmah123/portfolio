    longDescription: "As a co-founder of Applied Aero Labs, I led the design and construction of India's first portable, open-circuit, fan-array wind tunnel. The project involved mechanical design in SolidWorks, sensor integration with Arduino, and developing a custom control interface. We successfully secured a $12,000 government grant to fund the development and commercialization of this educational and research tool.",

    longDescription: "This research, conducted at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, investigated the effects of upstream pressure gradients on Reynolds stresses in turbulent boundary layers. Using high-fidelity Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) data, we analyzed turbulence structures and their transport. The findings were published in the International Journal of Heat and Fluid Flow, contributing to a deeper understanding of turbulence physics.",
